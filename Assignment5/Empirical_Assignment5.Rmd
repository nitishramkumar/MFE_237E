The maximum sharpe ratio squared based on the mean variance efficiency = $(\bar{R}^e)' \Omega^{-1} \bar{R}^e$  
  
*Proof*  

The aim is to minimize portfolio variance ($w' \Omega w$, where w is the weights and $\Omega$ is variance-covariance matrix), such that the portfolio returns reach the necessary value of *m*  
  
The objective function from the lagrangian form is   
  
*min* $\frac{1}{2} w' \Omega w - k (w' \bar{R}^e - m)$  
  
First order differential w.r.t w  and set it to 0 to minimize
  
$\Omega w - k \bar{R}^e$ = 0  
  
so $w^{MVE} = k \Omega^{-1} \bar{R}^e$  
  
so, ${\bar{R}^e}_{MVE} = (w^{MVE})' \bar{R}^e = k (\bar{R}^e)' \Omega^{-1} \bar{R}^e$
    
$var({R^e}_{MVE}) = (w^{MVE})' \Omega w^{MVE} = k^2 (\bar{R}^e)' \Omega^{-1} \Omega \Omega^{-1} \bar{R}^e$  
= $k^2 (\bar{R}^e)' \Omega^{-1} \bar{R}^e$
  
  
So, the Sharpe Ratio squared for MVE is  
${SR^2}_{MVE}  =  \frac{{\bar{R}^e}_{MVE}}{var({R^e}_{MVE})} = (\bar{R}^e)' \Omega^{-1} \bar{R}^e$    
  
*Max Sharpe Ratio Value*  
```{r echo=FALSE}
SharpeRatioSq.Max <- t(Avg.Hedged)%*%chol2inv(chol(Variance_matrix))%*%Avg.Hedged
sqrt(SharpeRatioSq.Max)
```

#4 
Maximum sharpe ratio squared of stocks and market =  Maximum sharpe ratio square of hedged stocks + sharpe ratio square of market
 
Max Sharpe Ratio = $(\bar{R}^e)'{\Sigma_F}^{-1} \bar{R}^e + (\alpha)' {\Sigma_e}^{-1} \alpha$  
  
Where first term is sharpe ratio of factor portfolio (in this case market) and second term is sharpe ratio of alphas.

##6e
The PCA Analysis shows that the 3 facts are significant in explaining the variance. The factor mimicking portfolio obtained through Fama-Macbeth doesn't completely resemble the market due to the presence of the intercept. It resembles the second PCA component which is a long-short portfolio (which has no correlation with market). Due to this difference with the market portfolio, the correlation doesn't come out to be 1.  
  
If we do the Fama-Macbeth regression without the intercept, the factor mimicking portfolio will resemble the market portfolio and hence the correlation will be higher than this correlation.
